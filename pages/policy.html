        <p>We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how we are processing the information collected by
            trifidu.github.io, which also provides the reasons why we must collect certain personal data about you.
            Therefore,
            you
            must read this Privacy Policy before using trifidu.github.io website.</p>
        <p>We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security.</p>
        <h3>Personal information we collect:</h3>
        <p>When you visit the trifidu.github.io, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
            including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your device.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you
            view,
            what
            websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
            automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal data
            you
            provide to
            us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information, etc.) during registration to
            be
            able
            to
            fulfill the agreement.</p>

        <h3>Why do we process your data?</h3>
        <p>Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only as much
            as
            it
            is
            absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected automatically is used only to identify
            potential
            cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website usage. This statistical information
            is
            not
            otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify any particular user of the system.</p>

        <p>You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could
            identify
            you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the website’s features, or
            you
            wish
            to
            receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such
            as
            your
            email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number. You can choose not to
            provide
            us
            with
            your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the website’s features. For
            example,
            you
            won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users who are uncertain
            about
            what
            information is mandatory are welcome to contact us via trifidu.mailer@gmail.com.</p>
